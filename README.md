This project is aimed to provide the simplest way to install kubernetes on bare-metal, virtual & Cloud environments.
Actually, Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) amd64, Centos 7/8 and RH are supported, but several other operating systems will be available soon.


This project is still under development. 
Feedback is very welcome via the
[GitHub site](https://github.com/ilkilab/agorakube)
as issues or pull (merge) requests.

Master branch is stable.

## Summary

This is a list of points that will be explained in this Readme file for the AgoraKube project :

- What is AgoraKube
- How to install
- How to give feedback
- How to contribute
- Licensing

## What is AgoraKube

AgoraKube is an easy-to-use, stable Kubernetes distribution (Kubernetes v1.15, 1.16).

By its symplicity, AgoraKube provide a good way to deploy and manage K8S Clusters.

AgoraKube is based on Ansible scripts that install and configure Kubernetes components (control plane and data plane) quickly on bare-metal / VMs / Cloud Instances, as systemd services.

This distribution is also adaptive by offering the opportunity to customize your deployment and fit to your needs : OS (default : Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) - amd64), DNS Service (default : CoreDNS), Ingress Controller (default : Traefik), Container Runtime (Default : Containerd), certificats, Service-Mesh (available: Linkerd)...

This project is actually under development so other customizable options will be added soon.

## How to install

We regularly use a machine to deploy every cluster. We only use it for deployment and destroy it after.

### Setup

#### On the "deployment" node
Execute this command in order to install Ansible and clone the repository :
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilkilab/agorakube/master/setup-deploy.sh)
```
#### On the K8S nodes
Execute this command on each node to update them and install the last version of Python : 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilkilab/agorakube/master/setup-hosts.sh)
```

### Installation instructions

To deploy your K8S cluster follow these [instructions](docs/instructions.md).
